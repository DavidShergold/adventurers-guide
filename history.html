        <h1>The Creation of Dornat</h1>
        <p>Countless aeons before recorded history, the great high-god Helistarian created the universe and countless
            worlds within it. At some point he created a world he named Dornat. No one knows what this word meant as it
            is in the language of the gods. After creating this world he then created many gods lesser than him to act
            as caretakers over his creation.

            At first, these gods chose to walk the surface of the world, turning it into their own paradise bringing
            into existence great oceans, forests, deserts and tundra. Eventually the gods tired of the material realm ad
            instead, retreated to the heavens and instead created mortal life on Dornat.</p>

        <p>The first life to appear took the form of animals, birds and fish. Next came the dragons and eventually
            creatures resembling humanoids that the gods named Samorians. For a time, everything was good but as the
            gods gave more and more bountiful gifts on their chosen children, large disasters started occurring. Huge
            earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tidal waves struck at random across Dornat. The gods realised that they
            had upset the delicate balance that held the world together.</p>

        <p>The gods separated themselves into two separate factions. Those who embraced creation, building and moving
            forward and those dedicated to destruction and decadence. These two groups realised that the prayers of the
            mortals they had created strengthened them began to actively influence the mortals into praying to their
            faction by offering them blessings and rewards in exchange for their worship. During this time, the
            Samorians, being the most easily influenced of the mortals, divided. Some into the light and some went to
            the darkness and over time, they began to change physically. Thus, elves and orc-kin came into the world.
        </p>

        <p>Sadly, this golden age was not to last. As the gods flaunted their powers in order to gain followers, the
            very planet began to show the strain being put upon it. A few of the gods from both factions realised what
            was happening and took measures. They formed a third faction. One that existed in the grey and was dedicated
            to preserving the balance in all things. They persuaded the other factions to meet together and organised a
            set of rules that all three groups must abide by. Firstly, none of the gods was allowed to interfere
            directly with the mortal races as their power was too much for the planet to contain. Secondly, they were
            not permitted to walk the surface of the world physically. Lastly, each god was to choose a particular
            domain to rule over, nature, the ocean, love, and death etcetera. The mortals facing these things in life
            would then pray to that god for aide, thus, strengthening that god.</p>

        <p>For the most part, the three pantheons kept to these new rules although they looked for loop holes whenever
            they could. They still appeared to mortals, although as spirits or in dreams instead of in person and used
            this new influence to guide their followers on the sly. A few times, they even guided them into situations
            that forced physical changes on them. Dwarves, gnomes, fairies, ogres, goblins and many more races came into
            being, some thriving and some remaining sparse.</p>

        <p>The gods continue their power struggle and the races of mortals continue to do what is needed in order to
            survive life on Dornat. </p>

            <h1>The Three Golden Ages of Dornat</h1>
            <p>There were three ages in the long history of Dornat that have been termed “golden ages”. These three
                periods
                that lasted, at the shortest, two hundred years, were ages where mortals reached the pinnacle of culture
                through one means or the other. During these times, there was no war. Little to no famine or plague and
                everyone had plenty. </p>

            <h1>The First Golden Age</h1>
            <h2 class="text-center">The Age of Perfection</h2>
            <p>This was considered, by most scholars to be the absolute apex of society that the peoples of Dornat have
                ever
                reached. At this stage, the gods had not long (by their view of time) been separated into separate
                pantheons
                and still freely mingled with their rival deities. The feuds and petty squabbles that would later cause
                such
                rifts between them had not been formed or been spilled into the minds of the mortal races.</p>

            <p>As such, the mortals were able to flourish both technologically and spiritually. It was not uncommon to
                see
                temples dedicated to the gods of good to be built along side those to the gods of darkness and, for
                their
                priests and priestesses to get along as good friends. A man could walk into a temple of Horshan, the god
                of
                plague, without being considered an evil man. It was not uncommon for followers of justice and peace to
                pray
                to the dark gods, showing them reverence in the hope they would not unleash their evils upon them.
                Generally, the people of the world, uninfluenced by the gods petty rivalries, did not see the praying to
                of
                certain gods to be taboo and, the world was a better place for it.</p>

            <p> Spell-casting was still a fresh concept to the mortal races and, manipulating the complex weaves of
                magic
                was still highly unexplored. However the discovery that magical power could stored inside precious
                stones
                and drawn off later (in much the same way that modern mages use their staffs) led to further exciting
                concepts. Many machines and contraptions had been designed by those with clever enough minds to do so in
                prior years, but had been abandoned due to a lack of power to fuel them. These “dragon-stones” as they
                became known, due to their volatile nature, were found to be able to supply these machines with the
                power
                they needed.</p>

            <p>These strange and unusual pieces of technology thrust the people of Dornat even more firmly into a golden
                age. Great ships flew through the air, carrying people the length and breadth of the globe. The Great
                Continent and its surrounding islands became mapped for the first time in perfect detail. This machine
                also
                allowed trade throughout Dornat and allowed differing cultures to learn about each other. New weaponry
                and
                tools were invented. Ones that needed little skill to operate and enabled food growth and hunting to
                become
                far easier, ensuring that poverty became a thing of the past.</p>

            <p>The very architecture of the cities of Dornat becomes more artistic. Slim yet tall building scrape the
                skies, linked to one another by vast walkways, high above the surface of the world. War becomes a thing
                of
                the past as people, enlightened by the religious and high-tech advancements around them. Sadly, this
                proved
                to be the ages downfall. When an elven mage discovered the concept of necromancy and tried to turn
                Dornat
                into their own play ground, there was very few who knew how to fight back.</p>

            <p>The First Golden Age fell. Its technological marvels and religious enlightenment quickly turning to dust
                and
                becoming a story of legend. Nothing more than an idealists dream of what mortal-kind can achieve. </p>

            <h1>The Second Golden Age</h1>
            <h2 class="text-center">The Age of Simplicity</h2>
            <p>If the First Golden Age had been the very heights to which mortal imagination could soar, then the Second
                Golden Age was the lowest. This does not mean it was a bad time however, after all, it was not referred
                to
                as
                golden for nothing.</p>

            <p>After the war against the undead finally came to an end and necromancy was outlawed, punishable by death,
                there was very little left of the races of mortals. The Samorian race appeared to have become extinct,
                believed by
                many to have been wiped out by the swarming undead and turned to its rotten ranks. The population of
                each
                surviving
                race had dwindled to its bare minimum. Fearing extinction themselves, each race began to distrust the
                others
                and
                slowly drifted back to their homelands. Isolating themselves from each other for many, many years.</p>

            <p>These small pockets of survivors however, began a hard, yet simple life. There was little to rebuild as
                the
                once mighty cities had crumbled to dust under the barrage of necromantic spells. As such, they simply
                started
                over. They had no machines left to do the hard work for them, so the people once again grew strong
                physically as
                they worked the lands to grow food and built villages for shelter. Over time, these little settlements
                turned
                into huge cities but, they were simpler and more functional compared to the cities of the First Golden
                Age.
            </p>

            <p>Magic became reviled and distrusted by many as they suspected all who wielded the arcane forces to be
                secret
                necromancers. Also no technological advances were made during this two hundred year period aside from
                refining steel producingtechniques. Tools and weapons took time to make as they were hand-forged and so
                this,
                along with the dwindling number of people in general, meant that for two centuries, there was no war. No
                skirmishes
                between rival villages. No bandits on the roads. No theft. No murder. Despite their lives of long, hard
                work
                filled days,
                the people of Dornat were at piece.</p>

            <p>The Second Golden Age ended when Thalgor, the orc-god incited a great anger within his children,
                encouraging
                them to wage war against the other races. This lasted many years until Elgun Orlaven, the Orc-Cleaver
                brought the war to an end.</p>

            <h1>The Third Golden Age</h1>
            <h2 class="text-center">The Age of Discovery</h2>
            <p>Upon the defeat of the rampaging tide of orcs that had swept across Dornat, a third age of peace fell
                upon
                the world. Very much like the second age, this one was partly caused by the dwindling population after
                the
                war with the orcs. Those that survived concentrated their efforts on rebuilding their lives and cities.
                Dwarven society, which appeared to have taken the least damage to its populace, led the way in this new
                age.
                Teams of dwarf engineers spread out across the world to help with the rebuilding, using their
                engineering
                skills to speed the building work up.</p>

            <p>The dwarves became much revered throughout Dornat at this point, due to their selfless giving and, as
                such,
                many other cultures took on aspects of dwarven society. The concept of family-led clans was adopted by
                smaller human and elvish villages and, dwarven style architecture became the height of fashion. The
                dwarves,
                whose proud and self-important nature became inflated by this and were more than happy to respond to
                such
                praise by teaching the race of humans their engineering knowledge. </p>

            <p>Steam-power became prevalent. Great machines, powered in this way became common-place. Added to this was
                the
                “Black-Powder” devices that the dwarves introduced. Cannons and rifles that could kill an enemy at a
                hundred
                paces, took the place of bows and swords. The use of steam led to the use of hot air. Once again, ships
                took
                to the skies, for the first time in several hundred years. This somewhat rickety mode of transport
                inspired
                those with adventurous souls to head into the world and explore. Ancient maps from the First Golden Age
                stoked the fire of adventure though, many of these maps were forged by those seeking to increase their
                fortunes at the expense of those they sold them to. As such, many a would-be explorer never returned to
                their homes but, were honoured as great heroes and pioneers. </p>

            <p>It was, of course, a time of peace. This peace only became threatened when the elves objected to the
                dwarves
                wish to hew down some of their great forests in order to build a flat, open area of land in which they
                wished to experiment further with their aviation technology. The dwarves, who had become used to doing
                more
                or less as they pleased, due to the high regard they were placed in, neglected to gain permission from
                the
                elves, whose land they were in. The elves chose to defend their precious woodlands. But, they revere all
                life so, first they sent a delegation to the dwarves, to ask them to stop their work, explaining that
                the
                trees were sacred to the elves. The dwarves scoffed at their pointy eared allies and stated that the
                trees
                were sacred to them also, as they were the fuel of their machines. The elves were outraged and forced
                the
                dwarves from their lands at bow-point. It was many, many years before a dwarf was allowed to set foot in
                Eldoryl again. </p>

            <p>Despite this one, minor problem, life during the Third Golden Age was one of great excitement and
                advancement
                for the people. Even mages, who had been shunned by many, after the war with the first necromancer, had
                started to become accepted once more and, the colleges of magic on Sorcerers Island became full of
                applicants again. Magical knowledge took great strides in those years and many mages worked alongside
                dwarven engineers to try and recreate the legendary Dragon-Stones that had powered the machines of the
                first
                age. Alas, such an endeavour proved fruitless and many gave up the pursuit, believing such knowledge to
                have
                been lost forever.

                (Note: Some orcish shaman had passed down this knowledge by word of mouth since the First Golden Age.
                The
                orcs, with their limited intelligence and understanding of the world, were never able to create
                Dragon-Stones with the same potential as human wizards had in years gone by, but they still had the
                basic
                knowledge which modern mages had lost.) </p>

            <p>For almost seven hundred years the races of Dornat prospered and flourished. Wars were almost unheard of,
                except for the occasional skirmish between clans. Yet, even these were little more than drunken
                arguments
                that had gotten out of hand. Sadly, as with the previous golden ages, this too came to abrupt end when
                the
                arch-devil, Zeniar invaded Dornat. Very quickly, huge portions of the mortal races were obliterated and
                again, much knowledge was lost. The dwarves retained much of it however, but chose to keep it to
                themselves,
                annoyed that the other races no longer held them in such high esteem as they failed to protect the world
                from Zeniar. </p>
