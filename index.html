        <h1>The Creation of Dornat</h1>
        <p>Countless aeons before recorded history, the great high-god Helistarian created the universe and countless
            worlds within it. At some point he created a world he named Dornat. No one knows what this word meant as it
            is in the language of the gods. After creating this world he then created many gods lesser than him to act
            as caretakers over his creation.

            At first, these gods chose to walk the surface of the world, turning it into their own paradise bringing
            into existence great oceans, forests, deserts and tundra. Eventually the gods tired of the material realm ad
            instead, retreated to the heavens and instead created mortal life on Dornat.</p>

        <p>The first life to appear took the form of animals, birds and fish. Next came the dragons and eventually
            creatures resembling humanoids that the gods named Samorians. For a time, everything was good but as the
            gods gave more and more bountiful gifts on their chosen children, large disasters started occurring. Huge
            earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tidal waves struck at random across Dornat. The gods realised that they
            had upset the delicate balance that held the world together.</p>

        <p>The gods separated themselves into two separate factions. Those who embraced creation, building and moving
            forward and those dedicated to destruction and decadence. These two groups realised that the prayers of the
            mortals they had created strengthened them began to actively influence the mortals into praying to their
            faction by offering them blessings and rewards in exchange for their worship. During this time, the
            Samorians, being the most easily influenced of the mortals, divided. Some into the light and some went to
            the darkness and over time, they began to change physically. Thus, elves and orc-kin came into the world.
        </p>

        <p>Sadly, this golden age was not to last. As the gods flaunted their powers in order to gain followers, the
            very planet began to show the strain being put upon it. A few of the gods from both factions realised what
            was happening and took measures. They formed a third faction. One that existed in the grey and was dedicated
            to preserving the balance in all things. They persuaded the other factions to meet together and organised a
            set of rules that all three groups must abide by. Firstly, none of the gods was allowed to interfere
            directly with the mortal races as their power was too much for the planet to contain. Secondly, they were
            not permitted to walk the surface of the world physically. Lastly, each god was to choose a particular
            domain to rule over, nature, the ocean, love, and death etcetera. The mortals facing these things in life
            would then pray to that god for aide, thus, strengthening that god.</p>

        <p>For the most part, the three pantheons kept to these new rules although they looked for loop holes whenever
            they could. They still appeared to mortals, although as spirits or in dreams instead of in person and used
            this new influence to guide their followers on the sly. A few times, they even guided them into situations
            that forced physical changes on them. Dwarves, gnomes, fairies, ogres, goblins and many more races came into
            being, some thriving and some remaining sparse.</p>

        <p>The gods continue their power struggle and the races of mortals continue to do what is needed in order to
            survive life on Dornat. </p>
