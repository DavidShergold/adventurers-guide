        <h1>The Magic of Dornat</h1>
        <p>The world of Dornat is a fantastical land steeped in powerful magics both old and new. Mighty beings can
            manipulate the magical web that crosses the length and breadth of the world but to do so requires not only
            great patience and study, but also a natural aptitude for the art. “A wizard is born, not created.” goes the
            old adage.</p>

        <p> It is not only the humanoid races that has mastery over these powers. Many creatures of Dornat are magical
            in nature, from the mighty dragons, to the delicate unicorn plus many more. These beasts who were born from
            the
            magic are naturally attuned to it and use it as naturally as a normal person would breathe. </p>

        <h1>The History of Magic</h1>
        <p>When the Over-God, Helistarian created the world of Dornat, he gathered forth all the mystical energies of
            the universe to do so. He made this energy into air, earth, fire and water and thus, the world of Dornat was
            born. The energies used to create this world permeated the very fabric of its being and lay dormant.</p>

        <p>Many thousands of years ago, when the gods still walked upon Dornat’s surface. In these days there was no
            evil within the world. Nor was there good, or neutrality. There was only existence. The dominant races were
            the Immortal Dragons, the civilised and peaceful Samorians and the tribal Orcs and their barbaric cousins,
            the trolls and goblins. The majestic and powerful dragons were the favoured of the gods and received many
            blessings from them, the greatest of which was the ability to tap into the latent energies sealed within the
            planet in order to mould the world around them as they saw fit. They called this energy, the Old Power.</p>

        <p>The races of the world existed in harmony with one another for many years. The dragons were the most
            dominant species and inhabited the central continents of Dornat, the Samorians, orcs, goblins and trolls
            inhabited the rest of the world and continued to thrive until one day, an unexplained plague struck the
            dragons. The source of this affliction has never been discovered but within mere decades, the dragon
            population was severely reduced.</p>

        <p>Eventually, the dragon king swallowed his pride and asked the other races for help, promising to share with
            them the secrets of wielding the Old Power if they could save his people. The other races searched for a
            remedy for many years before eventually discovering a solution. No one today knows what this solution was,
            but the dragon race was saved and, true to their words they taught the basics of their powers to their
            savours.</p>

        <p>The first druids, shaman and seers walked the planet.</p>

        <p>To these races, the Old Power came easily and they shaped their world around them as the dragons had done
            before, although without the same level of mastery. Over time, the gods introduced new races to Dornat,
            smaller races whose small bodies were infused with the Old Power. Fairies, pixies and others. Eventually,
            these races grew too complacent with their new, easier lives. They allowed the Old Power to do everything
            for them and they became lazy. As a result, their population shrivelled.</p>

        <p>As these races shrank and hid away from the world, new races appeared and claimed large portions of
            territory for themselves. The elves, dwarves and humans. The gods initially denied these people the gift of
            the Old Power, fearing they would bring about their own near demise as had their predecessors but over time,
            they proved themselves to be hard working and pioneering, so the gods allowed a few individuals access to
            the Old Power. These individuals rose to power among their own people and led them wisely, but over the
            generations, many chose to use the power as conquerors and tyrants.</p>

        <p>Unhappy with this turn of events, the gods tried to strip this power from the mortal races, but when greedy
            men attain power, they will not relinquish it so easily. Finding themselves unable to depower these mortals,
            they instead altered the nature of the Old Power, making it harder for men to wield it. Many mortals found
            themselves unable to wield this power now and many that could, could no longer control
            it. However, men are if nothing else, persistent.</p>

        <p>Those mortals who still had the power split into two groups. Those who had learned their lesson, and went to
            live in harmony with nature, seeking out the remains of the old races and learning the ways of druidism and
            shamanism from them. And those who still grasped at power.</p>

        <p>Those that grasped at the power still, began to research the nature of the power they sought. They found
            that through much study they could teach others to use a somewhat diluted version of the Old Power. These
            people
            founded the Order of the Mages. The power they wielded was known as magic and they were the first, and most
            powerful of what are known today as wizards. </p>

        <h1>The Zenyika</h1>
        <p> After Helistarian created the world of Dornat using the primal, chaotic energies of creation there was a
            residual energy left over. A chaotic, wild power that roamed the world long after the over-god had left his
            creation. This sprawling power wreaked havoc wherever it drifted, corrupting everything in its path. Many of
            the gods and mortals who knew of its existence realised the potential of controlling this entity and for
            many years they plotted and schemed ways to bring it under their control. They failed, repeatedly and for
            many, many years the Zenyika continued its havoc until it encountered Raniart, dark god of destruction. The
            Zenyika sensed a kindred spirit within Raniart and came to him almost passively. The dark god it seemed, had
            tamed the untameable and kept the power as his pet for many millennia until they unleashed the arch-devil
            Zeniar on the world. When Zeniar began his attack, Raniart bestowed his pet unto the devil to aid him in his
            endeavours. It has remained with him since.</p>

        <p>Over the centuries, the Zenyika has had countless effects on the shaping of the world of Dornat. It is
            believed by historians to have been the source of the mysterious “Dragon-Plague” that almost wiped out the
            dragon race and is widely known to have been the corrupting entity behind the downfall of the elven
            sorceress Olivier Soulstar, the first necromancer on Dornat, among many other events. </p>

    <div class="article" style="text-align: left;">
        <h1>Narsu</h1>
        <p>Many years ago when the gods forged the pendant and the sword for the Hero Tarn Samao to use against the
            arch devil Zeniar, they focused and merged their collective powers into one all-powerful essence. They
            poured this essence into the pendant and sword and called it "Narsu", meaning "Heaven's Hope" in the
            language of the Ancients.</p>

        <p>Years later after Tarn had returned the Pendant to the Lost Desert, his great grandson Polren Samao
            sought out the pendant. He made it as far as the desert but was bested by its guardian and was slain.
            However, Polren had never had any children and it seemed that the family of the Hero would be cut short.</p>

        <p>What no one knew though was that while the pendant had been resting, its internal essence had been
            evolving and had gained self-awareness. The entity within the pendant separated from the power and left
            the artefact, possessing the fallen Hero, gaining access to all his memories and personality.</p>

        <p>The resurrected Polren returned to the mortal realm rejuvenated and repowered and went on to do great
            deeds, eventually getting married and having two children, the second of which was a son of whom
            inherited his family’s legacy.</p>

        <p>The entity called Narsu left Polren and his body died again.</p>

        <p>The Narsu continued travelling the world seeking out people pure of heart and merging with them,
            strengthening them with its own energy. Since then, many of Dornat’s greatest heroes, local and world
            renowned have been briefly touched by the entity. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article" style="text-align: left;">
        <h1>Usran</h1>
        <p>The language of Dornat’s ancients is quite often very literal. The opposite for the old word for Left,
            “Arshun” is quite literally its opposite, “Nuhsra” meaning Right. Therefore, it does not take a great wise
            man to realise that Usran is the opposite of Narsu and is obviously the exact opposite in its nature too.
        </p>

        <p>After his second failure to conquer Dornat for his dark masters, Zeniar begged and pleaded for one last
            chance to avenge himself and force the mortals into servitude of the gods of evil. The dark-gods agree and
            freed him from his prison. They tasked him with finding several ingredients they needed to conduct a ritual
            that would enable them to create their own version of the Pendant of Narsu. A blood-red crystal filled with
            their own essence. They named this pendant, the Pendant of Usran.</p>

        <p> The Arch-devil’s power was now astronomical. He faced the Hero Natsumi Anlyon in battle, unleashing the full
            force of his new weapon, soundly defeating the girl and taking partial control of the land of Elhorn. </p>
