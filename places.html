        <h1>The Lands</h1>
        <p>Dornat is a land of breathtaking contrasts, where the terrain shifts from serene beauty to formidable danger
            with
            each passing mile. Its landscapes are shaped by ancient forces - both natural and mystical - that weave a
            rich
            tapestry of environments, each with its own secrets to uncover. Towering mountain ranges carve the horizon,
            their jagged peaks crowned with ice that never yields to the sun. Beneath them, deep valleys cradle emerald
            forests, where colossal trees whisper legends through rustling leaves. Some say the roots of these trees
            hold
            memories of a time before men and magic, binding the land to its history.</p>

        <p>Across Dornat's vast expanse, biomes vary as dramatically as the tides of its shifting seas. The Northern
            Desolace, scorched by ancient, celestial calamities, stretch endlessly in eerie silence, while the Jungles
            of
            Gyrrahal teem with life, their tangled vines and vibrant flora defying explanation. To the north, tundra
            shimmer
            beneath spectral auroras, while the deserts of Arol-Irad hum with sombre melodies carried by relentless
            winds.
            Rivers carve lifelines through Dornat’s heart, their waters infused with alchemical mysteries. Some flow
            crystal-clear, while others glow faintly under moonlight, hinting at deeper enchantments.</p>

        <p>Beyond the physical beauty of Dornat, its terrain bears the scars of legends, wars, and celestial influences.
            Canyons whisper with echoes of forgotten battles, and hidden caverns pulse with the energy of things best
            left
            undisturbed. Explorers and scholars alike have long attempted to map its depths, but Dornat refuses to be
            fully
            known, always shifting, always revealing new wonders to those daring enough to seek them. </p>

        <p> Whether you tread upon its soil in search of knowledge, glory, or mere survival, one thing remains certain:
            no one walks Dornat
            unchanged.</p>

                <h1>The Empire</h1>
                <p>The Empire stretches across most of the world of Dornat and consists of more or less, the entirety of
                    the civilised peoples. Humans, elves and dwarves make up the majority of the races within the Empire
                    but there are others that are governed by it.</p>

                <p>The seat of the Empire is the country of Elhorn and the city of Donst is the jewel in its crown. This
                    city has been the home to emperor’s since the empire was founded many, many centuries ago. The
                    empire itself was created shortly after the war against the first necromancer as a way to make
                    certain that
                    no war on this scale could happen again. The emperor is elected from among each country’s own rulers
                    and they remain emperor until he dies or abdicates.</p>

                <p>While the empire has one ruler that resides over the empire in its entirety, every country within the
                    empire has its own ruler, king, president etc. They rule over their own country, making certain that
                    their people abide by the empire’s rules and pulls its own weight. This last part is very important
                    as each country is to trade equally and fairly with the other countries, ensuring that everyone gets
                    what they need as and when they need it.</p>

        <h1>Donst, the Capital </h1>
        <p>Located in the north-western corner of Elhorn, lays the great city of Donst. This huge, mighty city is the
            capital of the civilised world. A centre for trade and commerce, a hub for artists and the fashion
            conscious,
            home to millions of citizens and, the throne of the empire.</p>

        <p>Donst is often referred to as the “King’s Pie” due to its round shape. Four districts act as the slices, one
            for
            traders, one for arts and entertainment, one for scholars and the last being the fashionable noble district.
            Around the edge of this great wheel and forming the “crust” is the residential district and at its centre is
            the
            royal palace.</p>

        <h1>The Shada’ath Monastery </h1>
        <p>Located in the northern hills of the country of Ja’arb, the Shada’ath Monastery was founded by a runaway
            princess and knightly her protector and lover. The princess, who was betrothed to a prince of a neighbouring
            kingdom had fallen in love with her bodyguard and wishing to be together, they eloped, heading north. The
            young knight was granted a vision from the gods of neutrality and blessed with their knowledge. He was
            granted a vision and opened up a school for warriors and adventurers to attend where he could teach the arts
            of war and combat in all its forms, hoping that he could show people a better path of enlightenment, using
            their skills to preserve and defend their people.</p>

        <p>The princess and the knight, whose names have been lost in the mists of time, were dedicated followers of
            the neutral gods and while there is no real deity worship enforced within the monastery, the students are
            encouraged to embrace the aspects and concepts of neutrality in their daily lives and philosophies. They are
            taught to see both sides of a situation before attempting to settle the matter in a way that is best for all
            parties.</p>

        <p>The training that the students receive include all forms of warfare and combat, such as, unarmed combat,
            weapons of all kinds, siege engines, mounted combat, tactics, philosophy, meditation and war politics.</p>

        <p>At the end of their training, the graduating students are given a runic brand, burnt into their forehead
            that will increase one of their most prominent natural abilities. For example, a fighter who is an excellent
            archer, might receive a rune that increases their level of eyesight enabling them to see further and
            clearer. Or a strong fighter could receive one that makes them more powerful physically or a nimble fighter
            more agile, etc.</p>

        <p>Upon receiving this mark, they are then sent into the world to test their new skills. Many of the students
            spend their lives wandering the lands aiding the people, or fighting in great wars. Many of Dornat’s great
            heroes have graduated the Shada’ath. Some graduates return home and become a champion of their town or
            village, defending it from bandit, or beast attack, some become officers in the UAD. Finally, some ex
            students, after spending a few years honing their skills, choose to return to the Monastery to become monks
            and teach the next generation of students. </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">The Grand Melee </h2>
        <p>Every four years, the Monastery holds “The Grand Melee”. A huge tournament where warriors from around the
            world, come together to participate for great rewards. There are several competitions to take part in, such
            as archery, wrestling, jousting, fencing, but the main attraction is the Grand Melee itself. A free for all
            combat. This happens over several rounds. As there are normally hundreds of entrants, the first round
            divides them all into two teams, and these two teams clash in a huge battle. The winning team going onto the
            next stage.</p>

        <p> following round is a series of preliminary heats, one on one battles, all happening at the same time
            across multiple battlegrounds, whittling down the participants until there are just ten. Then the finals
            begin. The finals happen one after another, the entrants drawing lots and fighting those they are put up
            against,
            until only one is left. This person is then crowned The Champion of the Grand Melee.</p>The

        <p>There are only a few rules in the tournament. Firstly, no enhanced mortals are allowed to participate, this
            includes the monks or other Shada’ath branded, people using magic to enhance themselves or the current
            “Chosen” of the Family of the Hero.</p>

        <p>No spell casting is allowed.</p>

        <p>Lastly, there will be no deaths or unfair advantages in the preliminary stages. A magic “Null-Death” field
            is placed over any stages that will be used preventing death and grave injury. Also, all participants are
            equipped with standard weapons and armour, although they may choose the style they use.</p>

        <p>The winners of the various competitions receive generous rewards such as gold and magical artefacts. The
            Grand Champion receives a special gift. They receive a “Partial-Brand” on their forehead similar to those
            graduating from the monastery, although not as powerful.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Shada’ath Mages </h2>
        <p>The Shada’ath Monastery also has a wing of the building inhabited by mages from Sorcerer’s Island. The
            students of the monastery are allowed to take classes in battle magics.
            The mages here also hold their own competition during the Grand Melee. A magic contest, where spell casters
            who have received no formal training can show off their skills. The prize for which is normally an
            apprenticeship under a mage back on Sorcerer’s Island.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article" style="text-align:left;">
        <h1>The Holy City of Vengato</h1>
        <p>The holy city of Vengato lays on an island in the middle of Lake Venga in central Elhorn. The city was built
            in the year 6343BN by followers of the gods of light, who later became the first priests and eventually
            priest-mages. The location of the future city was shown to Valnozz Myrahel who would go on to gather other
            worshippers, draw up plans for the city and oversee the building before being ordained as the city’s first
            arch-priest.</p>

        <p>While there had been clerics and priests operating on their own, preaching about the gods of light, this was
            the first time that such people had been brought together, organised and working together for the greater
            good instead of at odds with each other.</p>

        <p>Within half a decade of the city’s completion, worship of the gods of light had spread across the whole of
            Elhorn and was becoming more popular across seas too, with many clerics from other countries coming to
            Vengato to be ordained as a priest of the light. Humans, elves, dwarves and even some dragons in humanoid
            form were enrolled.</p>

        <p>The gods of light looked upon this magnificent city filled with grand temples, churches and cathedrals
            dedicated to them, and watched the men and women who had sworn servitude to them as they did good deeds in
            their name and brought more worshippers to their alters and smiled. They decided to reward their most
            dedicated followers by blessing them with the gift of miracles. They granted them the ability to perform
            divine magic that came from prayer to the gods as apposed to the study of natural forces as used by mages.
            These few could pray for protection, cleansing, healing and the most devout had been known to return life to
            the dead. The chosen few who could perform such feats became known as priest-mages.</p>

        <p>Priest-mages formed the top tier of the holy orders, travelling the lands and setting up new churches in
            towns around Dornat and they became the foremost defence against evil attack, usually in the form of
            exorcisms, healing wounds or curing plague and sickness. Over time, some priest-mages decided to take a more
            aggressive stance against such forces, merging their holy magics with holy augmented weapons and armour.
            These became the first Paladins and even today such people roam the lands doing good deeds in the name of
            their gods. Paladins also serve as the guards of the city of Vengato defending the citizens and priests as
            they go about their day to day lives.</p>

        <p>n the year 325AN, during the war against the rogue mage and cleric of the dark gods, Borovar, Vengato was
            completely levelled by dragon-fire while the paladins and priest-mages held off a ground attack by orcs and
            goblins. After Borovar was destroyed, the city was rebuilt even more glorious than before with most of it
            streets and buildings being constructed from pure white marble and its central cathedral coated in silver
            and gold.</p>

        <p> It is in Vengato that the coronation of the new emperors of the United Countries of Dornat takes place along
            with royal weddings and funerals.</p>

        <p>To the east of the city, back on the mainland is the Vengato cemetery. This cemetery is the largest on all
            of Dornat, measuring in at 80 acres of land. Kings, emperors, clergy, heroes and many others have been
            buried here since Vengato was built. Only those who have served the light may be buried here and the land is
            consecrated so that most creatures of darkness would be burned upon setting just one foot into the
            graveyard. However, this has not prevented stronger demons and devils from trying to corrupt the area or
            performing dark rights within the lands.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, the cemetery is patrolled by paladins and priest-mages to keep these already rare occurencies to
            a minimum. </p>

        <h1>The Mausoleum </h1>
        <p>Beneath the great and holy city lays one of its darkest secrets. The speck of evil within this city of the
            pure.
            The fabled Mausoleum. Many hundreds of miles of tunnels and chambers wind their way around the underside of
            the
            city housing the corpses and remains of the most evil of people to have worked the face of Dornat.</p>

        <p>Whenever such a person is slain by a paladin or priest-mage, their remains are brought back and laid to rest
            within these crypts. The walls, floors and ceiling of the Mausoleum are consecrated by the priest-mages of
            the
            city regularly and they prevent the souls of the dead from ascending to their hellish domain where they
            could
            potentially be reborn as devils. The spirits instead, are incarcerated in this morbid prison, tortured by
            the
            inherent good of the city above for all eternity</p>

        <p>The Mausoleum is not only home to the restless dead however. Many, many years ago, after the arts of
            necromancy
            became outlawed, one practitioner of this dark magic beseeched the gods of light, offering his wicked skills
            to
            their service if he only be allowed to continue his practice. The gods of light, in their benevolence,
            permitted
            him his request. They tasked him with watching over the spirits of the damned within the Mausoleum, charged
            with
            making certain these spirits never attempt to leave or cause trouble.</p>

        <p>In return for his endless service, the necromancer is allowed to continue his foul experiments. This man,
            known
            simply as The Attendant, whose name has been lost to all during his unnaturally long life, spends his days
            as
            jailer to the dead, harvesting their corpses to create all manner of shambling, undead abominations.</p>

        <p>The final purpose of the Mausoleum is to test aspiring paladins. Deep within the centre of tis massive crypt
            lays a shrine to the gods of light. The young paladin must journey through the halls of the dead to pray at
            this
            shrine. The journey is long and hard as they must fend off the dead at every turn and constantly run the
            risk of
            getting lost within the miles of tunnels. To make matters worse, should they make it close to this shrine,
            the
            Attendant often likes to administer his own final test, pitting the young aspirant against one of his
            latest,
            wicked creations.</p>

        <h1>The Great Library </h1>
        <p>Deep in the Jungles of Lerz, there exists a tower so tall, its top is said to touch the clouds. This tower is
            known
            by the simple name, The Great Library. It is believed to have existed since the beginning of the age of
            mortals and
            its function is to record the complete history of Dornat. The current librarians are a mixture of human, elf
            and
            dwarf. However, no one knows who its original inhabitants were.</p>

        <p>The librarians go out into the world, travelling far and wide, recording all events they see, from huge wars,
            to
            domestic celebrations. As they record, the librarians begin to use their strange and unique brand of magic…
        </p>

        <p>One of the unique properties of the library is that a copy of anything that is written down anywhere in the
            world,
            from books, to shopping lists, will appear in a room at the top of the tower in a chamber they call the
            “Sorting
            Room”. One of the jobs of the librarians is to sort through everything and decide what is worth keeping. Of
            course,
            books, diaries, and scrolls are generally kept but other important things may be recorded on scraps of
            parchment,
            and as such, must be stored or re-copied into books.</p>

        <p>As the library holds every thing ever recorded since the beginning of history, the library is also home to
            many
            manuscripts, tomes and scrolls that are incredibly dangerous. Books of dark magic and prophesy that in the
            wrong
            hands could cause irrevocable harm.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, the librarians have taken a very strict vow to protect all written works, regardless of their
            origin
            and as such, many of the chambers are sealed with ancient magic and in many cases, not even the lower ranked
            librarians are allowed access.</p>

        <p>Access to the library by general civilians is prohibited as most of the works are ancient and as such very
            fragile.
            However, the non-prohibited works are available to all and as such the librarians will make copies of the
            books to
            be handed out. The only people who are allowed access to the library other than the librarians are mages and
            priests and even then,
            only under the strictest supervision.</p>

        <h1>The Cradle of the Elements</h1>
        <p>Deep within the desert continent of Shama’Alora, is the tallest mountain on all of Dornat. This mountain is
            so
            tall, it is said to be a ladder to the heavens themselves although none have ever scaled its rocky face. The
            mountain is home to the titans, huge forces of nature that guard the sacred Cradle of the Elements. This
            ancient
            artefact regulates the ebb and flow of the four elements, air, earth, fire and water, from their originating
            planes, to the realm of Dornat, preventing the world from having too much, or too little of each.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article" style="text-align:left;">
        <h1>Sorcerer’s Island</h1>
        <p>The seat of magical studies known as wizardry is situated on a small island off the east coast of Elhorn and
            is
            known colloquially as “Sorcerer’s Island”. Although it is a modestly small island, it was chosen for the
            natural
            lines of magical energy that converge at its centre. The school was set up centuries ago after the gods
            removed
            from man the ability to use the Old Power. Mortal man, having tasted this raw power in their fingertips, did
            not
            wish to loose such power and sought mastery of a more easy to use, diluted version of energy control.</p>

        <p>The collages themselves comprise of many magnificent and, sometimes impossible buildings. There are eight
            main
            buildings, the Grand-Master schools and the collage itself is run by the Archmage, the most powerful wizard
            currently alive.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">School of Seeing</h2>
        <p>Students who study here are taught by the Grand-Master Seer. Here they learn the arts of seeing with the eyes of
        a mage instead of the eyes of a mere mortal. Using this ability, they can see things others cannot, such as the
        lines of magic and perhaps even the immediate future! They are also taught the art of scrying, using flames or
        water to see other places.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">School of the Elements</h2>
        <p>These lessons are taught by the Grand-Master Elementalist. While here, the student-mage learns to have some
        control over the natural elements of the world, Fire, Earth, Water and Air. Conjuring these elements or bending
        them to the sorcerer’s whim are perhaps one of the things that mages are most known for, yet it is often
        considered by mages to be the hardest thing to gain full mastery over,</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">School of Healing</h2>
        <p>Here, the young mages are taught by the Grand-Master Healer, He or she is normally a Priest-mage from Vengato.
        In this school the students learn the arts of “Spoken Healing” and “Herbal Healing”.
        Spoken healing is the ability to heal minor words through word and thought alone. They do this by actually
        willing the wound to heal. This is extremely difficult though and is only usually used successfully by
        exceptionally skilled wizards, or those that dedicate themselves to the healing arts and become priest-mages.
        Herbal healing is easier for most mages to accomplish. With this they learn about the healing properties of
        plants etc.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">School of War</h2>
        <p>Although the mages prefer to use their skills for peaceful ends, they are sometimes forced to go into combat to
        protect their island from evil wizards, such as liches and necromancers, or during times of war or even to
        simply protect themselves or companions from attack.
        The trainee wizards are required to spend a lot of time in this school preparing themselves for just such an
        eventuality.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">School of Alchemy</h2>
        <p>Many of the mages potions and spell-components are comprised from various minerals. Also, much of their spell
        casting has its roots in scientific basis. It is in this school that the young mages learn about physics,
        chemicals and biology.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">School of Dreams</h2>
        <p>This is the most basic of all the magical lore. All of the basest magic are formed by dreams and among the
        higher level mages of Sorcerer’s Island they are considered to have great power. Dreams can be used to predict
        future occurrences and messages can be sent via the “Dream-Scape”.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">School of Power</h2>
        <p>This is the final school the mages attend before graduating. The lessons here are taught by the Archmage
        himself. In this school the novice mages learn the higher levels of magic and are tested several times on what
        they have learnt. The mages are sworn to secrecy on pain of death about what happens within this school.</p>
