        <h1>The Lands</h1>
        <p>Dornat is a land of breathtaking contrasts, where the terrain shifts from serene beauty to formidable danger
            with
            each passing mile. Its landscapes are shaped by ancient forces - both natural and mystical - that weave a
            rich
            tapestry of environments, each with its own secrets to uncover. Towering mountain ranges carve the horizon,
            their jagged peaks crowned with ice that never yields to the sun. Beneath them, deep valleys cradle emerald
            forests, where colossal trees whisper legends through rustling leaves. Some say the roots of these trees
            hold
            memories of a time before men and magic, binding the land to its history.</p>

        <p>Across Dornat's vast expanse, biomes vary as dramatically as the tides of its shifting seas. The Northern
            Desolace, scorched by ancient, celestial calamities, stretch endlessly in eerie silence, while the Jungles
            of
            Gyrrahal teem with life, their tangled vines and vibrant flora defying explanation. To the north, tundra
            shimmer
            beneath spectral auroras, while the deserts of Arol-Irad hum with sombre melodies carried by relentless
            winds.
            Rivers carve lifelines through Dornat’s heart, their waters infused with alchemical mysteries. Some flow
            crystal-clear, while others glow faintly under moonlight, hinting at deeper enchantments.</p>

        <p>Beyond the physical beauty of Dornat, its terrain bears the scars of legends, wars, and celestial influences.
            Canyons whisper with echoes of forgotten battles, and hidden caverns pulse with the energy of things best
            left
            undisturbed. Explorers and scholars alike have long attempted to map its depths, but Dornat refuses to be
            fully
            known, always shifting, always revealing new wonders to those daring enough to seek them. </p>

        <p> Whether you tread upon its soil in search of knowledge, glory, or mere survival, one thing remains certain:
            no one walks Dornat
            unchanged.</p>

                <h1>The Empire</h1>
                <p>The Empire stretches across most of the world of Dornat and consists of more or less, the entirety of
                    the civilised peoples. Humans, elves and dwarves make up the majority of the races within the Empire
                    but there are others that are governed by it.</p>

                <p>The seat of the Empire is the country of Elhorn and the city of Donst is the jewel in its crown. This
                    city has been the home to emperor’s since the empire was founded many, many centuries ago. The
                    empire itself was created shortly after the war against the first necromancer as a way to make
                    certain that
                    no war on this scale could happen again. The emperor is elected from among each country’s own rulers
                    and they remain emperor until he dies or abdicates.</p>

                <p>While the empire has one ruler that resides over the empire in its entirety, every country within the
                    empire has its own ruler, king, president etc. They rule over their own country, making certain that
                    their people abide by the empire’s rules and pulls its own weight. This last part is very important
                    as each country is to trade equally and fairly with the other countries, ensuring that everyone gets
                    what they need as and when they need it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article" style="text-align:left;">
        <h1>Donst, the Capital </h1>
        <p>Located in the north-western corner of Elhorn, lays the great city of Donst. This huge, mighty city is the
            capital of the civilised world. A centre for trade and commerce, a hub for artists and the fashion
            conscious,
            home to millions of citizens and, the throne of the empire.</p>

        <p>Donst is often referred to as the “King’s Pie” due to its round shape. Four districts act as the slices, one
            for
            traders, one for arts and entertainment, one for scholars and the last being the fashionable noble district.
            Around the edge of this great wheel and forming the “crust” is the residential district and at its centre is
            the
            royal palace.</p>

    <div class="article" style="text-align:left;">
        <h1>The Shada’ath Monastery </h1>
        <p>Located in the northern hills of the country of Ja’arb, the Shada’ath Monastery was founded by a runaway
            princess and knightly her protector and lover. The princess, who was betrothed to a prince of a neighbouring
            kingdom had fallen in love with her bodyguard and wishing to be together, they eloped, heading north. The
            young knight was granted a vision from the gods of neutrality and blessed with their knowledge. He was
            granted a vision and opened up a school for warriors and adventurers to attend where he could teach the arts
            of war and combat in all its forms, hoping that he could show people a better path of enlightenment, using
            their skills to preserve and defend their people.</p>

        <p>The princess and the knight, whose names have been lost in the mists of time, were dedicated followers of
            the neutral gods and while there is no real deity worship enforced within the monastery, the students are
            encouraged to embrace the aspects and concepts of neutrality in their daily lives and philosophies. They are
            taught to see both sides of a situation before attempting to settle the matter in a way that is best for all
            parties.</p>

        <p>The training that the students receive include all forms of warfare and combat, such as, unarmed combat,
            weapons of all kinds, siege engines, mounted combat, tactics, philosophy, meditation and war politics.</p>

        <p>At the end of their training, the graduating students are given a runic brand, burnt into their forehead
            that will increase one of their most prominent natural abilities. For example, a fighter who is an excellent
            archer, might receive a rune that increases their level of eyesight enabling them to see further and
            clearer. Or a strong fighter could receive one that makes them more powerful physically or a nimble fighter
            more agile, etc.</p>

        <p>Upon receiving this mark, they are then sent into the world to test their new skills. Many of the students
            spend their lives wandering the lands aiding the people, or fighting in great wars. Many of Dornat’s great
            heroes have graduated the Shada’ath. Some graduates return home and become a champion of their town or
            village, defending it from bandit, or beast attack, some become officers in the UAD. Finally, some ex
            students, after spending a few years honing their skills, choose to return to the Monastery to become monks
            and teach the next generation of students. </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">The Grand Melee </h2>
        <p>Every four years, the Monastery holds “The Grand Melee”. A huge tournament where warriors from around the
            world, come together to participate for great rewards. There are several competitions to take part in, such
            as archery, wrestling, jousting, fencing, but the main attraction is the Grand Melee itself. A free for all
            combat. This happens over several rounds. As there are normally hundreds of entrants, the first round
            divides them all into two teams, and these two teams clash in a huge battle. The winning team going onto the
            next stage.</p>

        <p> following round is a series of preliminary heats, one on one battles, all happening at the same time
            across multiple battlegrounds, whittling down the participants until there are just ten. Then the finals
            begin. The finals happen one after another, the entrants drawing lots and fighting those they are put up
            against,
            until only one is left. This person is then crowned The Champion of the Grand Melee.</p>The

        <p>There are only a few rules in the tournament. Firstly, no enhanced mortals are allowed to participate, this
            includes the monks or other Shada’ath branded, people using magic to enhance themselves or the current
            “Chosen” of the Family of the Hero.</p>

        <p>No spell casting is allowed.</p>

        <p>Lastly, there will be no deaths or unfair advantages in the preliminary stages. A magic “Null-Death” field
            is placed over any stages that will be used preventing death and grave injury. Also, all participants are
            equipped with standard weapons and armour, although they may choose the style they use.</p>

        <p>The winners of the various competitions receive generous rewards such as gold and magical artefacts. The
            Grand Champion receives a special gift. They receive a “Partial-Brand” on their forehead similar to those
            graduating from the monastery, although not as powerful.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Shada’ath Mages </h2>
        <p>The Shada’ath Monastery also has a wing of the building inhabited by mages from Sorcerer’s Island. The
            students of the monastery are allowed to take classes in battle magics.
            The mages here also hold their own competition during the Grand Melee. A magic contest, where spell casters
            who have received no formal training can show off their skills. The prize for which is normally an
            apprenticeship under a mage back on Sorcerer’s Island.</p>
